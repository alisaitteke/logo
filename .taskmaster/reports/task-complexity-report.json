		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project and Cloudflare Services",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initialization into: Astro frontend setup, Cloudflare Worker configuration, R2 bucket creation, KV namespace setup, Cloudflare Images configuration, environment variable management, and DNS/routing setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves orchestrating multiple Cloudflare services (Workers, R2, KV, Images), configuring environment variables, and ensuring DNS/routing is correct. Each component has its own setup and integration steps, and misconfiguration can lead to cascading issues. Testing requires verifying both infrastructure and application-level connectivity. Industry best practices recommend modularizing such setups for maintainability and reproducibility."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement External Logo Provider Integrations",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: utility function for getlogo.dev, utility function for logo.dev, and abstraction/interface for provider logic.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating with external REST APIs is a common pattern, but requires careful error handling, abstraction for extensibility, and rate limit management. The technical challenge is moderate, with most complexity in designing a clean, extensible interface for providers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Key Generation and Storage",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: email validation logic, API key generation, and KV storage with metadata.",
			"reasoning": "API key generation and storage is a standard backend task. Using UUIDs and KV storage is straightforward, but ensuring uniqueness, secure storage, and proper validation adds some complexity. Testing is simple but must cover edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Cloudflare Images for Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: uploading to Cloudflare Images, generating transformation URLs, handling SVG conversion/fallback, and integrating with Workers for dynamic URL generation.",
			"reasoning": "Image optimization and transformation involve understanding Cloudflare Images API, handling various formats, and integrating with Workers. SVG handling and security (signed URLs) add complexity. Testing must cover multiple image scenarios and performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Build Astro Frontend for Dashboard and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: dashboard layout, API key management page, statistics dashboard, documentation page, and API integration for dynamic data.",
			"reasoning": "Building a modern frontend with Astro and Tailwind is standard, but integrating dynamic data, ensuring accessibility, and maintaining a clean architecture require careful planning. Testing for responsiveness and accessibility is essential."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Key Validation Middleware",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: API key existence/validity check, rate limiting logic, and middleware integration with routing framework.",
			"reasoning": "Middleware for API key validation and rate limiting is a common requirement. Using KV for counters and integrating with Hono or custom logic is straightforward, but must be robust against abuse and race conditions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Multi-Provider Failover Logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: sequential/chained provider calls, logging provider responses, storing provider metadata in R2, and selecting the best logo.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing failover logic requires careful orchestration of asynchronous calls, error handling, and logging. Storing and associating metadata with assets adds to the complexity. Ensuring the best logo is selected involves additional logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Track and Store Request Statistics",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: incrementing stats in KV, bandwidth tracking (if feasible), and aggregation/reporting logic.",
			"reasoning": "Tracking and storing statistics is a common backend pattern. Using atomic KV operations and designing for aggregation/reporting adds moderate complexity. Bandwidth tracking may require additional logic depending on available APIs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Magic Link Email Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: token generation and storage, email sending integration, magic link endpoint, token validation, and key/stat retrieval logic.",
			"reasoning": "Magic link authentication involves secure token generation, expiry management, email delivery integration, and secure endpoint design. Handling edge cases (expired/invalid tokens) and ensuring security (JWT/signed tokens) increase complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create API Endpoints for Logo Retrieval",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: endpoint routing and parameter parsing, API key validation, cache lookup and fetch logic, and error handling/response formatting.",
			"reasoning": "Developing robust API endpoints with parameter parsing, authentication, cache logic, and error handling is moderately complex. Using Hono or itty-router simplifies routing, but integration and testing remain non-trivial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Logo Caching and Storage in R2",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: storing logo binaries in R2, metadata management in KV, cache-control/invalidation logic, and retrieval logic.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing efficient caching and storage with R2 and KV requires understanding S3-compatible APIs, designing key structures, and managing cache invalidation. Testing cache hit/miss scenarios adds to the effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Statistics Dashboard Backend API",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: stats aggregation logic, authentication (magic link/API key), and endpoint response formatting.",
			"reasoning": "Building backend endpoints for statistics retrieval is standard, but requires careful aggregation logic and secure authentication. Ensuring data accuracy and completeness is important."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Documentation and Example Usage",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: endpoint/parameter documentation and code sample creation/testing.",
			"reasoning": "Providing documentation and usage examples is essential but not technically complex. Ensuring accuracy and completeness, and testing code samples, are the main challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize SEO and Performance for Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: SEO/meta tag/sitemap configuration and performance optimization (asset/image optimization, edge caching).",
			"reasoning": "SEO and performance optimization are well-understood tasks with established best practices and tooling. The main effort is in configuration and verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Security, CORS, and Error Handling Best Practices",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: CORS header implementation, input validation/sanitization, error response formatting, and dependency auditing.",
			"reasoning": "Security and error handling are critical and require attention to detail. Implementing CORS, input validation, and robust error responses is moderately complex, especially when following best practices and ensuring coverage across all endpoints."
